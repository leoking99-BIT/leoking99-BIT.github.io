## About Me
My name is Kai Liu (刘凯).  I got my PhD from [IVRC](https://github.com/bit-ivrc)  of Beijing Institute of Technology.
I was also a visiting student working under the supervision of [Prof. Umit Ozguner](https://car.osu.edu/people/ozguner.1) at [CAR](https://car.osu.edu/) in Ohio State University from 2015 to 2017.

My research interests cover the area of motion planning and control algorithms, simulation for autonomous cars. My focus is more about optimization-based and sampling-based motion planning algorithms subject to differential contraints.
I developed several handy simulation tools to support motion planning and control algorithms testing of autonomous driving system based on [V-REP](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) as well.

I was a main contributor to several awesome autonomous driving projects from motion planning and simulation aspects: [Autonomoose](http://www.autonomoose.net/), [Skyline(Renesas Car)](https://www.renesas.com/en-us/about/press-center/news/2017/news201701042.html), [BlackBerry QNX Autonomous Prototype Vehicle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAjntsc8MR0) from 2016 to 2017.

In 2017, I attended the CES(Consumer Electronics Show) in Las Vegas to show the functional safety, autonomy of our autonomous driving system running on low power consumption R-Car H3 SoC. It's a big success!
