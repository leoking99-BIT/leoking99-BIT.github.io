## Personal
My name is Kai Liu(刘凯). I like autonomous vehicles! More specifically, trajectory tracking controller design for vehicles with interesting dynamics. While in grad school I discovered that I am fascinated by numerical methods, especially those used for simulation, control, and optimization.

I completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Beijing Institure of Technology(BIT) in 2008.
Then, I continued my graduate work under the supervision of [Prof. Jianwei Gong](http://me.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jlgcx/qjyjs/bssds2/86320.htm) at BIT, where I earned my M.S. in 2010.
I got my PhD degree under the supervision of Prof. Huiyan Chen in [IVRC](https://sites.google.com/site/ivrcbit/home) at Beijing Institute of Technology in 2019.
I also worked as a visiting scholar under the supervision of [Prof. Umit Ozguner](http://wavelab.uwaterloo.ca/?page_id=593) at [CAR](http://wavelab.uwaterloo.ca/) in Ohio State University from 2015 to 2017.


My research covers the area of motion planning and control, dynamics modeling and simulation for autonomous vehicles, model predictive control and reinforcement learning. My focus is more about optimization-based control algorithms subject to handling stability contraints.
I developed several handy simulation tools to support motion planning and control algorithms testing of autonomous driving system based on [V-REP](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/), Simulink and [CarSim](https://www.carsim.com/).

## Work experience

I am a motion plan and control engineer at UISEE, where I work with autonomous ground vehicles.
Previously I was at SIAT-CAS, where I developed data acquisition and control code for electric vehicles.
